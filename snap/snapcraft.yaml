summary: Twine, a tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories 
description: |
  You don't need to write any code to create a simple story with Twine
  but you can extend your stories with variables, conditional logic,
  images, CSS, and JavaScript when you're ready.
  Twine publishes directly to HTML, so you can post your work nearly 
  anywhere. Anything you create with it is completely free to use any 
  way you like, including for commercial purposes.
  Twine was originally created by Chris Klimas in 2009 and is now 
  maintained by a whole bunch of people at several different repositories.
